# ðŸš€ Unmaksing Team Rocket
In real-world scenarios like security and fraud, threats may not look alike â€” but often act alike. Inspired by Team Rocketâ€™s shared intent despite different roles, this project explores learning behavioral patterns to detect threat-like actions.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Build a binary classifier to detect threat-like behavior
- Tackle an imbalanced dataset (82:18 non-threat to threat)
- Use models like Random Forest and XGBoost
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
